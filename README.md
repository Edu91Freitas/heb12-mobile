Heb12 Mobile is a free mobile open-sourced app for reading the bible. It currently features 5 translations (soon to be more) and a clean, simple, and efficient GUI.

The app originally started on May 2nd, 2018 as a simple demo in MIT's App Inventor. It was later re-written in Html5 so it could be fast and easy to modify. Heb12 Mobile will launch sometime in late February or March.
